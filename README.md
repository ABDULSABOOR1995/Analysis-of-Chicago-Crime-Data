# EDA of Chicago Crime Data

## Context
This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days. Data is extracted from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. In order to protect the privacy of crime victims, addresses are shown at the block level only and specific locations are not identified. Should you have questions about this dataset, you may contact the Research & Development Division of the Chicago Police Department at 312.745.6071 or RDAnalysis@chicagopolice.org. Disclaimer: These crimes may be based upon preliminary information supplied to the Police Department by the reporting parties that have not been verified. The preliminary crime classifications may be changed at a later date based upon additional investigation and there is always the possibility of mechanical or human error. Therefore, the Chicago Police Department does not guarantee (either expressed or implied) the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or correct sequencing of the information and the information should not be used for comparison purposes over time. The Chicago Police Department will not be responsible for any error or omission, or for the use of, or the results obtained from the use of this information. All data visualizations on maps should be considered approximate and attempts to derive specific addresses are strictly prohibited. The Chicago Police Department is not responsible for the content of any off-site pages that are referenced by or that reference this web page other than an official City of Chicago or Chicago Police Department web page.

##### Now I'll describe the project in detail with screen shots.


### 1. Data Reading:
First of all I read data from CSV files that I have downloaded from kaggle and created its data frame.
<br><br><br>
![Screenshot_89](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46135898/68811915-9b149d00-0693-11ea-9b14-1144043b23b7.png)
<br><br><br>

### 2. Data Understanding:
Then I started understanding data by applying basic pandas statistical methods on the data frame.

<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>

### 3. Data Cleaning:
Now I prepared data for analysis by removing unnecessary columns that exist in the above table(data frame) and by filling missing values was exist in data frame.
